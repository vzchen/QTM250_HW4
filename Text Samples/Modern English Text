FIRST HALF:
Is this a dagger I see in front of me, 
with its handle pointing toward my hand? 
Come, let me hold you. 
I don’t have you but I can still see you. 
Fateful apparition, isn’t it possible to touch you as well as see you? 
Or are you nothing more than a dagger created by the mind, 
a hallucination from my fevered brain? 
I can still see you, 
and you look as real as this other dagger that I’m pulling out now. 
You’re leading me toward the place I was going already, 
and I was planning to use a weapon just like you. 
My eyesight must either be the one sense that’s not working, 
or else it’s the only one that’s working right. 
I can still see you, 
and I see blood splotches...

SECOND HALF:
...on your blade and handle that weren’t there before. 
There’s no dagger here. 
It’s the murder I’m about to do that’s making me think I see one. 
Now half the world is asleep and being deceived by evil nightmares. 
Witches are offering sacrifices to their goddess Hecate. 
Old man murder, having been roused by the howls of his wolf, 
walks silently to his destination, moving like Tarquin , 
as quiet as a ghost. 
Hard ground, don’t listen to the direction of my steps. 
I don’t want you to echo back where I am 
and break the terrible stillness of this moment, 
a silence that is so appropriate for what I’m about to do. 
While I stay here talking, Duncan lives. 
The more I talk, the more my courage cools.
